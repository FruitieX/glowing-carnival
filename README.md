# glowing-carnival

Platformer game for Finnish Game Jam 2016.

## Setup

A web server is needed to play the game. You can either set one up yourself, or
use the included node.js static server script as follows:

## Installing and using node.js static server

1. Install `nodejs` and `npm`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Note that the node.js server disables the `Cache-Control` header, so your
browser should always fetch the latest code when you refresh the page.
