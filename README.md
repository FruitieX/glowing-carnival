# glowing-carnival

Platformer game for Finnish Game Jam 2016.

## Setup

A web server is needed to play the game. You can either set one up yourself, or
use the included node.js static server script as follows:

## Installing and using node.js static server

1. Install `nodejs` and `npm` using your package manager or
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` (if that fails try `nodejs server.js || node server.js`)

The node.js server will auto-reload your browser when any source files change,
and has `Cache-Control` disabled so you always use the latest code.
